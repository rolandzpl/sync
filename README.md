# sync
Lab project to test system startup synchronization

Because there was an issue in my project that the system was starting up and
aggressively processing events even thought that it was not ready yet, there was
a necessity to find out some synchronization solution.

This project is kindof proof of concept for the solution to be appliedto production.
